## **Title**
**Digital Signal Processing Techniques for EEG-Based Emotion and Mental State Recognition Using Machine Learning (2022â€“2025)**

---

## **1. Background of the Study**

Digital Signal Processing (DSP) plays a crucial role in analyzing complex biomedical signals such as Electroencephalogram (EEG) data, which provide vital information about brain activity, emotional states, and cognitive patterns.  
EEG signals are inherently non-stationary and susceptible to noise, requiring DSP techniques like **bandpass filtering**, **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**, and **Wavelet Decomposition** to extract relevant frequency and timeâ€“frequency features.

Recent studies (2022â€“2025) demonstrate that combining DSP-based feature extraction with **Machine Learning (ML)** models â€” such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks â€” enhances classification accuracy for emotion and mental state recognition.  
This integration enables the development of more intelligent and responsive systems for **humanâ€“computer interaction**, **stress monitoring**, and **mental health assessment**.

This proposal focuses on reviewing recent advancements in DSPâ€“ML frameworks for EEG-based emotion recognition and identifying effective methodologies, challenges, and future directions for potential system development in the Final PIT implementation phase.

## **2. Objectives of the Study**

1. To review 2022â€“2025 research studies utilizing DSP-based preprocessing and feature extraction on EEG signals for emotion or mental state recognition.  
2. To identify commonly used ML algorithms and their corresponding performance metrics in EEG signal classification.  
3. To analyze recurring challenges such as noise reduction, feature redundancy, and model overfitting in EEG-based DSP pipelines.  
4. To recommend future research directions for improving reliability and efficiency in EEG emotion recognition systems.

## **3. Methodology**

This study adopts a **systematic review approach** focusing on peer-reviewed works published between **2022 and 2025**.  
Articles will be gathered from **ScienceDirect**, **Frontiers**, and **PubMed Central**, emphasizing studies integrating **DSP techniques** with **ML-based classifiers** for EEG emotion or mental state analysis.

Each selected study will be examined according to:
- EEG dataset used  
- DSP and feature extraction techniques (FFT, DWT, PSD, entropy, band energy)  
- Machine learning models (SVM, CNN, LSTM)  
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)  

Comparative tables will summarize the reviewed approaches, results, and limitations.  
The final review paper (to be written after this proposal) will follow **IEEE double-column formatting** and span at least five pages excluding references.

## **4. Scope and Limitations**

- Focus: EEG-based emotion and mental state recognition systems.  
- Methods: Integration of DSP feature extraction with ML classification algorithms.  
- Exclusions: Other physiological signals (e.g., ECG, EMG) and hardware implementations.  
- Data: Only secondary data from open-access repositories and journal publications.  
- Output: Literature-based synthesis, not experimental testing.

## **5. Expected Output**

The expected output of this proposal is a **review paper plan** that consolidates DSP and ML techniques applied to EEG-based emotion recognition.  
The forthcoming review (final PIT paper) will:
- Identify the most effective DSP pipelines and ML classifiers,
- Present comparative performance results,
- Highlight current research gaps, and
- Suggest improvements for real-time and lightweight EEG recognition systems to be implemented in the Final PIT.
